"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?"

This mod is inspired by the [c/dddd00:Terraria x Majora's]
[c/dddd00:Mask] YouTube series by Wand of Sparking.

=== SUMMARY ===
Every [c/ff0000:3 days], the world and your inventory will be [c/ff0000:reset], including your Piggy Bank, Safe, Defender's Forge and Void Bag.
Can you beat the Moon Lord with the limitations imposed by this mod?

=== MECHANICS ===
Every 3 days, the world will be regenerated as if it were a new world.

You, the player, will be allowed to bring 3 items from your inventory into the newly-generated world from the old world.
Exceptions to this rule are tools.
You [c/ff0000:will not] be given a Copper Pickaxe and Copper Axe after a world reset.

Defeating bosses required for progression will grant [c/00ff00:an additional item slot] for transferring items.
Required bosses include:
  Skeletron
  Wall of Flesh
  the Mechanical bosses
  Plantera
  Golem
(All three Mechanical bosses have to be defeated in order to get the additional item slot.)

Defeating a boss and obtaining its [c/ffff00:Mask drop] will consider that boss to be [c/00ff00:defeated] for the rest of your playthrough.

Money contained in your [c/ffff00:Piggy Bank] is preserved across world resets.  Money contained elsewhere (e.g. your inventory) is [c/ff0000:not] preserved, so be careful!

=== OTHER INFORMATION ===
Playthroughs must begin with a new player and a new world.

Defeating the [c/ffff00:Moon Lord] will halt the mechanics mentioned earlier.
